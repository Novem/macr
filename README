macr - Randomizes MAC Addresses and much more

SYNOPSIS
    macr [ -ehps ] [ -i interface ] [ -m ADDRESS ] [ -v vendor ]

DESCRIPTION
    Macr is a mac spoofing application writen in python3 for linux. If ran
    without arguments macr well come up with a random address and apply it
    to the interface defined in /etc/macr.conf. This is great quick and easy 
    address spoofing. However, this is not the fullest extent of macr's 
    capabilities. Macr can randomizes the end of the address, pick a 
    random vendor OUI, use a profile, or even allow you to
    define an address manually.
    
    Macr was originally inspired be mac_spoof.py write by a5an0 and is 
    avalable here http://wiki.hak5.org/index.php?title=MAC_Randomizer and
    parts of macr's macRand function are borrowed from mac_spoof.py
    
OPTIONS
    -e --end
        Randomizes the last 3 bytes of the mac address
        and leaves the OUI as it is.

    -h --help
        Displays help massage and exits.

    -p PROFILE --profile PROFILE
        Instead of randomizeing the address the macr will go to the profile
        file and use the address associated in that the given profile. 
        In the default file the profile sequence will yeild 00:11:22:33:44:55
        and deadbeef will yeild 00:DE:AD:BE:EF:00.
        
    -s --show
        Displays the current address and exits.

    -i INTERFACE --interface INTERFACE
        Manually sets which interface to use. If this is not used macr will
        use the interface defined in /etc/macr.conf.

    -a ADDRESS --adderess ADDERESS
        Manually sets the mac address.

    -m VENDOR --manufacturer VENDOR
        Sets the first 3 bytes to match a mac address
        of the given vendor. For example Ieee8021 will 
        yield a address beganing with '00:0F:AC', or '00:80:C2'
