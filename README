macr - Randomizes MAC Addresses and much more

SYNOPSIS
    macr [ -ehpsV ] [ -i interface ] [ -m ADDRESS ] [ -v vendor ]

DESCRIPTION
    Macr is a mac spoofing application writen in python3 for linux. If ran
    without arguments macr well come up with a random address and apply it
    to the interface defined in /etc/macr.conf. This is great quick and easy 
    address spoofing. However, this is not the fullest extent of macr's 
    capabilities. Macr can randomizes the end of the address, pick a 
    random vendor OUI, grab an address from a macr.conf, or even allow you to
    define an address manually.
    
    Macr was originally inspired be mac_spoof.py write by a5an0 and is 
    avalable here http://wiki.hak5.org/index.php?title=MAC_Randomizer and
    parts of macr's macRand function are borrowed from mac_spoof.py
    
OPTIONS
    -e --end
        Randomizes the last 3 bytes of the mac address
        and leaves the OUI as it is.

    -h --help
        Displays help massage and exits.

    -p --predefined
        Instead of randomizeing the address the macr will go to the file 
        /etc/macr.conf and use the address in that file. 
        The default address is 00:11:22:33:44:55 

    -s --show
        Displays the current address and exits.

    -V --version
        Displays version number and exits

    -i INTERFACE --interface INTERFACE
        Manually sets which interface to use. If this is not used macr will
        use the interface defined in /etc/macr.conf.

    -m ADDRESS --mac ADDERESS
        Manually sets the mac address.

    -v VENDOR --vendor VENDOR
        Sets the first 3 bytes to match a mac address
        of the given vendor. For example Ieee8021 will 
        yield a address beganing with '00:0F:AC', or '00:80:C2'
